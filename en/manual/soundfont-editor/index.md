When a soundfont is created or when an existing one is opened, a new tab containing a soundfont editor appears.

A soundfont editor is made of:

* a [tree](manual/soundfont-editor/tree.md) on the left, representing the architecture of the soundfont;
* a [toolbar](manual/soundfont-editor/toolbar.md) on the top (in blue in the picture);
* a main area that can either contain an [editing page](manual/soundfont-editor/editing-pages/index.md) or a [configuration summary](manual/soundfont-editor/configuration-summaries.md), depending on what is selected in the [tree](manual/soundfont-editor/tree.md).
