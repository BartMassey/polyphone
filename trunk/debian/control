Description: soundfont editor
 Polyphone is a free software for editing soundfonts in format sf2.
 These files contain a multitude of audio samples put together and
 configured so as to form musical instruments that can be used by
 synthesizers such as fluidsynth and played using a MIDI keyboard.
 The goal of Polyphone is to provide:
  - a simple and efficient interface for creating and editing .sf2 files,
 available on both Linux and Windows,
  - tools to facilitate and automate the setting of different parameters,
 making it possible to handle a large amount of data.
 .
 Main features:
  - support of sf2 format v2.01 and v2.04,
  - support for 24 bits samples,
  - support for jack and asio audio servers,
  - analysis of frequency peaks and estimation of sample pitch,
  - automatic loop of samples, with steady state detection and use of a
 crossfade,
  - simultaneous edition of every samples of an instrument,
  - specific tools for musical instrument creation,
  - a recorder, for the record of what is played in a .wav file,
  - built-in synthetizer, using a virtual keyboard or midi signals,
