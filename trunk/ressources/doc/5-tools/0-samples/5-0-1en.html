<p align="justify">The software seeks a stable area of the sample and then artificially creates a loop. A sound segment is copied with a crossfade, so that the transition at the join location is as smooth as possible.</p>
<p align="justify">If no suitable loop points can be found, a warning message will appear.  This can happen if a sample is not long enough or is too turbulent.</p>
<p align="justify">Warning: this tool modifies the original sample. Modifications can be undone via the "<a href="qrc:/aide/1-1fr.html">undo</a>" function, but if the file is saved and Polyphone is closed there is no way to step back.</p>
