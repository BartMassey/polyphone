<p align="justify">The software seeks a stable area of the sample and then artificially creates a loop. A sound segment is copied with a crossfade, so that two positions in the sound correspond exactly.</p>
<p align="justify">Warning: this tool modifies the original sample. Modifications can be undone via the "<a href="qrc:/aide/1-1fr.html">undo</a>" function, but if the file is saved and Polyphone is closed there is no way to step back.</p>
