<p align="justify">The transposition tool allows the transposition of an entire instrument. The sounds of the instrument are thus the same, but at a different position over the keyboard.</p>

<p align="justify">As input, a shift in terms of semitones is required. For the pitch to be higher, the shift must be positive. Conversely, for the pitch to be lower the shift must be negative. The operations performed by the tool, for each division of the instrument, are then as follows:
<ul>
	<li>shift of the key range according to the number of semitones,</li>
	<li>consequently, the root key is adjusted,</li>
	<li>modification of the fine tuning if the transposition is performed by a number of semitones including decimals.</li>
</ul>
</p>
