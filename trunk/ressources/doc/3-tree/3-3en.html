<p align="center"><img src="qrc:/aide/arbre3.png" /></p>

<p align="justify">When a string is inserted into the search bar:
<ul>
	<li>if the string is included in the name of an instrument or a preset, instruments and presets are displayed as well as their divisions,</li>
	<li>if the string is included in the name of a sample, the samples concerned as well as all instruments containing these samples are shown.</li>
</ul>
A click on the cross to the right of the editable field cancels the filter.<br /><br />
The tree can also be completely collapsed or expanded thaks to the two buttons on the left.
