<h3>Sample loading</h3>

<p align="justify">The sample preparation begins by <b>loading</b> .wav files, using the action "Import samples" in the "<a href="qrc:/aide/1-0en.html">Files</a>" menu. They may be obtained:
<ul>
	<li>through Internet,</li>
	<li>by recording a real musical instrument,</li>
	<li>by synthesis using a specialized software.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Sample looping</h3>

<p align="justify">Next, a <b>loop</b> may be required in the sample. This is the case for example of a flute sound: the length of the sample can be only one second but we would like to make it last indefinitely. Two positions, the start and end of the loop, has to be found in the sound wave so that locally the wave can be superimposed. Here is the method:
<ul>
	<li>click in the <a href="qrc:/aide/3en.html">tree</a> on the sample to be looped,</li>
	<li>in the editing page of <a href="qrc:/aide/4-1en.html">samples</a>, arbitrarily position the start and end of the loop in the <a href="qrc:/aide/4-1-0en.html">graphic</a> if no loop is already defined,</li>
	<li>authorize looping and start playback,</li>
	<li>adjust the start and / or end of the loop until the transition between the two positions is not noticeable.</li>
</ul>
If the looping process is tough, this <a href="qrc:/aide/5-0-1en.html">tool</a> may help.
</p>

<h3>Sample tuning</h3>

<p align="justify">Finally, a <b>tuning</b> has to be done. To do this, a calibration tool is available in the editing page of <a href="qrc:/aide/4-1en.html">samples</a>. For each sample the method is as follows:
<ul>
	<li>begin the playback (button "play"), if possible with loop,</li>
	<li>add the sine calibration and adjust the volume to hear the two sounds as clearly as possible,</li>
	<li>change the root key so that the two sounds best coincide,</li>
	<li>adjust the correction to tune the sample with to root key (for this we must be attentive to the beating and make sure it is as slow as possible).</li>
</ul>
The <a href="qrc:/aide/4-1-2en.html">frequency</a> analysis can be a good indicator to start tuning.
</p>

<h3>To go further</h3>

<p align="justify">Several tools are available to edit samples like:
<ul>
	<li><a href="qrc:/aide/5-0-3en.html">removing blank</a> at start,</li>
	<li><a href="qrc:/aide/4-1-3en.html">equalizing</a> the sound,</li>
	<li><a href="qrc:/aide/5-0-7en.html">transposing</a>,</li>
	<li><a href="qrc:/aide/5-0-5en.html">normalizing</a> the volume,</li>
	<li><a href="qrc:/aide/5-0-6en.html">adjusting the balance</a> for stereo samples.</li>
</ul>
</p>
