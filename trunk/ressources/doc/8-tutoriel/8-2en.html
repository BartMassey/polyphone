<p align="justify">From this step, it is considered that one or more instruments are available for the creation of a preset.</p>

<h3>What is a preset?</h3>

<p align="justify">A preset is the entity visible from outside a soundfont and is identified by a bank number and a preset number. Each preset contains one or more instruments, such as instruments contain one or more samples.</p>

<h3>Creating a preset and adding instruments</h3>

<p align="justify">First of all, click on "New preset" in the <a href="qrc:/aide/2-0en.html">toolbar</a> if the icon is present, or in the <a href="qrc:/aide/3-1en.html">contextual menu</a> of the tree on one of the elements of the soundfont being edited. A name has to be filled for our new preset.</p>

<p align="justify">Then add instruments in the preset using a "<a href="qrc:/aide/3-2en.html">drag & drop</a>" in the tree: divisions appear in the preset.</p>

<p align="justify">It is possible to create as many presets as instruments, each preset containing only one instrument.</p>

<h3>Setting up a preset</h3>

<p align="justify">Changing the preset parameters may not be required since:
<ul>
	<li>when creating a preset, bank number and preset number are automatically assigned,</li>
	<li>when adding a instrument in a preset the key range is automatically calculated according to the instrument.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p align="justify">In the scope of this tutorial, the creation of a soundfont is over!</p>
