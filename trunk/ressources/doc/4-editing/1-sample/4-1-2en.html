<p align="justify">The frequency analysis includes a Fourier transform (graph showing the intensity of frequencies present in the signal). On the right is shown the list of dominant peaks with the following information:
<ul>
	<li>ratio between the peak intensity and the intensity of the maximum peak,</li>
	<li>frequency,</li>
	<li>corresponding key,</li>
	<li>correction.</li>
</ul>
From these data an estimate of the pitch of the sound is made. This estimate can be used for tuning.
