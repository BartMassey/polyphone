COMPILATION

The following libraries are required (the name may vary depending on your system):
 - qt (libqt4-gui, libqt4-core, libqt4-svg, maybe others)
 - alsa (libasound2-dev / alsa-lib-devel)
 - jack (libjack-jack2-dev / jack-audio-connection-kit-devel)
 - portaudio (libportaudio2 / portaudio-devel)
Use your package manager to install them: synaptic, yum,...

Links may be adjusted in the file polyphone.pro. If libportaudio is not found for example, first locate it on your system and edit the following line:
LIBS += /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libportaudio.so.2
It could be:
LIBS += /usr/lib64/libportaudio.so.2

Run "qmake && make" (or qmake-qt4 && make) in the root directory to compile the project. An executable file "polyphone" in the directory "RELEASE" should then appear if everything went right.

If you are using QT Creator, the project may be opened via its .pro file present in the root directory. Take care shadow build is not checked (project properties).
