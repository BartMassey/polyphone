COMPILATION

Run "qmake && make" in the root directory to compile the project. An executable file "polyphone" in RELEASE directory should then appear if everything went right.
Please note that QT libraries are required, svg features included.

If you are using linux, you will need to install alsa, portaudio2 and jack headers (libportaudio2, libasound2-dev and libjack-jack2-dev).

If you are using QT Creator, the project may be opened via its .pro file present in the root directory. Take care shadow build is not checked.
