COMPILATION

Run "qmake && make" in the root directory to compile the project. An executable file "polyphone" in RELEASE directory should then appear if everything went right.
Please note that QT libraries are required, along with QT Multimedia Kit.

If you are using linux, you will need to install alsa and jack headers (libasound2-dev and libjack-jack2-dev).

If you are using QT Creator, the project may be opened via its .pro file present in the root directory.
